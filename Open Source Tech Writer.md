Please consider me for the position of Open Source Tech Writer.

Why?

I have a passion for working with developers and being part of, and serving, the developer community. A passion for open source software goes along with this. This international collaboration for the common good, for shared gain and shared learning, I see as part of the initial promise of the internet, and hearteningly, a part that is growing. Technical qualification: I have contributed to open source (as well as private repos) on GitHub, so far just for documentation and learning, but hopefully on the coding side in the future. I am comfortable with the basics of making a pull request and confident of my ability to continue to learn more of the nuances of git (be it via GitHub or GitLab or another source management system).

I write about tech on a near daily basis, often in a marketing capacity, but also for an internal developer audience. I began my technical writing career at Addamax documenting a kit one integrated into a Unix kernel so the resulting operating system complied with B-1 level security (a US government standard). Technical qualifications: I have documented boot-level startup sequences, how to write device drivers, how to change user interfaces, and how to release iOS apps into Apple’s review queue (and more, that’s just a sampling). I am comfortable reading through source code to understand how a product works or to attempt to discern why it doesn’t. (I have also done rudimentary bug fixing of user interface errors.) Here’s something I wrote a while back about my Swift learning journey: https://medium.com/@SuzGupta/how-to-ask-for-help-coding-2d7a9a1031c1. I can provide other writing samples upon request. 

For the past five years, I have worked remotely with international development teams, including many non-native speakers. I have managed other consultants and worked in a variety of job functions for a small educational software company and more recently an indie Mac software house as well. Although my graduate degree in journalism and Silicon Valley and London experience fall solidly in the realm of technical writing, I have a strong understand of all aspects of the software development lifecycle. Technical qualifications: I am comfortable with a wide variety of collaborative communication tools, such as the Google suite, Slack, Skype, and even some more arcane apps such as TeamSpeak and TeamViewer. I’m confident I could learn whatever is in use in a new setting.

Although I am not at this point a blockchain or Ethereum expert, I look forward to the opportunity to learn in detail about this new realm and to help developers worldwide make open source contributions to tools in this space.

Kind regards from suburban Chicago,

Susannah
